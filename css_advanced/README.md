# HTML Advanced

This project is part of the **ALX Front-End Curriculum**, focusing on building a complete webpage from scratch using **semantic HTML** based on a provided Figma design. This phase emphasizes structuring content meaningfully without applying any CSS styling (yet).

## 📝 Project Description

In this project, you are provided with HTML starter code to save time and shift focus towards mastering **CSS layout and styling** in the following stages. However, it’s essential to understand the **HTML structure** and how each section is semantically organized.

The webpage includes the following sections:

- Header (with logo and navigation links)
- Banner (with headings, text, and a CTA button)
- Quote section
- Videos list (with video previews, author info, and ratings)
- Membership plans
- FAQ
- Footer (with branding and social links)

All content is arranged as per the Figma design linked below.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Implement clean, semantic HTML structure based on a UI mockup.
- Practice organizing content using HTML5 sectioning tags (`<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, etc.).
- Prepare the structure for styling in the upcoming CSS Advanced project.
